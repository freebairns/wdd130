          Director of Operations for Holiday River Expeditions since 1978
          
          Tim is Holiday River Expeditions' Director of Operations and COE (Chief of Everything). He makes sure our trips run smoothly, so your vacation is trouble-free.
          
          Obviously, with 40+ years of guiding and running our operations, Tim knows what he’s doing and does it well.
          
          When he’s not training guides, inspecting gear, answering 101 questions Tim enjoys Utah’s great places on his mountain bike or skis with his wife, Vicky, and his children and grandchildren. It’s hard to get Tim to sit in any one place for very long, so if you see him say, “Hi!” before he disappears with his bike and his dog River.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>There is a much longer story of how I got hooked on rivers, and it takes at least 4 days in a boat to tell, but I have been in love with rafting since I was 17. I haven’t found anything since that makes me feel more alive, and in tune with my surroundings than pushing a piece of rubber down the river with good people. The guides at Holiday have become my family, and the camaraderie that exists when you are forced to share the same Bano for a summer is unlike no other.</figcaption>

          Guiding for Holiday River Expeditions since 1976
          
          I started with Holiday River Expeditions in 1976, the year we proved to Dee H. that you don’t need to use motors to cover river miles—oar power was the way back then and is today. Over these many years, the river and river canyons have not physically changed much; to me, it is our guests, new and old, that change how I view the river experience each trip.
          
          After spending 13 years as a boatman and manager for the Vernal operations, I did take about a 20 years hiatus to pursue a career in finance and to save for retirement; as I said I could always return. So in 2011, I did. So far the body is holding up and the experiences are awesome. Maybe the change is in me; several trips have involved returning guests who came as kids on vacation with their parents and are now doing trips with their families. These are the rich rewards I cherish.
