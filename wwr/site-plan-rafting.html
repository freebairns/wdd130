        <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>We hope you will join us on one of our multi-day whitewater rafting trips. With our extensive experience and thoughtful planning, you‚Äôll experience the ultimate Western adventure vacation.</p>
  <h3>For Families & all visitors .</h3>
  <p>Our extensive experience guides will plan the trip to suit your needs.</p>
  <p>CLASS 1- EASY LEVEL
    This is the level that represents river waters that flow over minimal obstructions.  There is minimal risk for the rafter. This would be suitable for a float-trip with no whitewater. And families with young kids or elderly.</p>
    
  <p>CLASS 2- NOVICE LEVEL
    When you graduate from the easy and usually non-thrilling easy level you land into the novice level.  One key characteristic is visible obstructions that can be easily avoided. And families with older kids.</p>
    
  <p>CLASS 3- BEGINNER / (INTERMEDIATE) LEVEL
    You are now seeking more thrills from white water rafting.  Rapids, eddies and moderately strong waves become harder to navigate.  You can expect to be getting wet at this level.  Performing maneuvers, and boat control, is key to running class 3 rapids.</p>
    
  <p>CLASS 4‚Äì ADVANCED LEVEL
    The rafting experience and skill level required is scaling higher and higher.  With more turbulent waters, holes, and constricted passages, must-make fast and precise moves are required to successfully go through these difficult rapids.  It is recommended to take a scouting mission down the course before the first rafting experience downstream.</p>
    
  <p>CLASS 5‚Äì EXPERT LEVEL
    This level is for very experienced rafters who are capable of executing preventive and self-rescue moves even in high-pressure occurrences.  Rapids are long, violent, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous.  The expert level requires appropriate equipment, practiced rescue skills and experienced team of experts.  The class 5 level is unique from the levels of difficulty that are below it in that it harbors varied difficulty levels other than the + and ‚Äì ratings.  Here you will find 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 and so on with the latter being more difficult than the former.</p>
    
  <p>CLASS 6- EXTREME / EXPLORATORY WATERS
    Are you a daredevil in whitewater rafting?  Are you willing to risk death?  Then this extreme level is yours to explore.  The risk is maximized.  Class 6 waters are unpredictable and extremely dangerous.  In the unlikely event of continued successful rafting on a class 6 rapid it may eventually downgrade to a class 5.  The room for error is zero even for rescue missions with quality equipment and teams.</p>
